# 1.1 MINIMUM CIRCOS CONFIGURATION 
#
# This is a 'hello world' Circos tutorial. 
#
# Only required configuration elements are included.
#
# Subsequent tutorials in this section build on this example to
# generate a representative image with common elements found in Circos
# figures in the literature.

# Chromosome name, size and color definition
karyotype = circos_brain_network/circos_brain_node_t41.txt

# The <ideogram> block defines the position, size, labels and other
# properties of the segments on which data are drawn. These segments
# are usually chromosomes, but can be any integer axis.

<ideogram>

<spacing>
# Spacing between ideograms. Suffix "r" denotes a relative value. It
# is relative to circle circumference (e.g. space is 0.5% of
# circumference).
default = 0.02r

# You can increase the spacing between specific ideograms.
#<pairwise hsY;hs1>
#spacing = 20r
#</pairwise>

</spacing>

# Ideogram position, thickness and fill. 
#
# Radial position within the image of the ideograms. This value is
# usually relative ("r" suffix).
radius           = 0.75r
#radius           = 0.50r

# Thickness of ideograms, which can be absolute (e.g. pixels, "p"
# suffix) or relative ("r" suffix). When relative, it is a fraction of
# image radius.

thickness        =160p
#thickness        = 80p

# Ideograms can be drawn as filled, outlined, or both. When filled,
# the color will be taken from the last field in the karyotype file,
# or set by chromosomes_colors. Color names are discussed in
#
# http://www.circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/configuration_files
#
# When stroke_thickness=0p or if the parameter is missing, the ideogram is
# has no outline and the value of stroke_color is not used.

fill             = yes  
stroke_color     = dgrey
stroke_thickness = 2p   

# Ideogram labels
show_label       = yes
# see etc/fonts.conf for list of font names
label_font       = bold 
label_radius     = 1.0r + 75p
#label_radius     = 1.5r + 75p
label_size       = 150
label_parallel   = no
